
Hallo!
This is the opening wuahhauahuah (jk, hahah).
So lemme explain how does it works:
First we'll ask you the number of questions and then,
Questions will appear on the screen.
Then we'll ask you to choose 
the correct answer you think from 3 options.
You can input the answer as the name of variant,
or directly as a word.
If you want to write the answer a letter (name of variant),
you've to write just like this: " a "
That's it. Good Luck!!!
