NEW FEAUTURES:

	We've the vocabulary as csv file, so we can use that.
	Don't forgot to apply "variants" part..


CHANGES WHICH ADDED:

	As version1, there was no variants
	Version2 was version1 but with variants.
	(But I had some issues with it, and I found another solution of it so I created version2_1.
	I mean, there was a problem with shuffling values 'cause the answer was "c" always..)
	And one feauture about Version2 I'd like to say issssss-
	The User can input the answer both varian name and word [YASS, I DID THIS FOR NOTHING XDMKSMDKAMDKAM]
	Of course, both are made with vocabulary dict.

	Version3 will be made with csv file :D
